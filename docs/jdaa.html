					<b>JSON-Driven API Automation (JDAA)</b>: A Revolutionary New Standard for API Testing
					JSON-Driven API Automation (<b>JDAA</b>) is an innovative approach to API test automation that prioritizes
					simplicity, scalability, and accessibility. Based on the use of JSON files or objects as a central
					configuration source, <b>JDAA</b> eliminates the need for detailed coding to create tests, allowing even
					developers with no experience using tools like Cypress to create and run tests efficiently.

					What Makes <b>JDAA</b> Innovative?
					<b>JDAA</b> transforms API testing by allowing all requests, validations, and flows to be configured
					directly in JSON files or JavaScript objects. This approach completely abstracts the complexity of
					traditional methods like cy.request in Cypress, simplifying automation operations. With <b>JDAA</b>, you
					just describe what the test should do and the framework takes care of executing the technical
					details.

					This approach makes <b>JDAA</b> a solution not only for testers, but also for developers who want to
					quickly and efficiently integrate API validations into their workflow.
				</p>
				<p>
					How does <b>JDAA</b> work?
					At the heart of <b>JDAA</b> is the idea of ​​declarative configuration. Instead of writing imperative code
					for every API operation, you define the following information in a JSON:

					Request Type <b>(GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)</b>:
					Specify which operation will be performed.
					Endpoint:
					Enter the URL or relative path of the API to be tested.
					Payload (Request Body):
					Configure the data sent for operations such as POST or PUT.
					Validations (Expect):
					Describe what should be validated in the response, whether it's a specific field, an HTTP status, or
					both.
					Schema:
					Validate response contracts using predefined JSON structures, ensuring the API follows the expected
					specification.
				</p>

				<p>
					Benefits of <b>JDAA</b>
					Ease of Test Creation:

					Tests can be created quickly by just configuring settings in JSON. This drastically reduces the
					learning curve and technical barrier for new testers and developers.
					Multidisciplinary Collaboration:

					As test creation is data-centric (JSON), both testers and developers can collaborate on automation
					without the need for advanced technical knowledge.
					Robust Validations:

					Integrated support for value validations, contracts (schemes) and logical expressions.
					Scalability and Simplified Maintenance:

					Changes to tests are made directly in JSON, without modifying the code, making the maintenance
					process quick and efficient.
					Boilerplate Abolition:

					Completely removes the need to write repetitive code such as cy.request and manual assertions.
